# NodeJS
Node.js is a runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript code outside of a browser. It's built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is the same engine used by Google Chrome to execute JavaScript.

Here are some key points about Node.js:

Server-side JavaScript: While JavaScript was traditionally used only for client-side scripting in web browsers, Node.js enables developers to use JavaScript for server-side programming. This means you can build full-stack applications using only JavaScript.

Asynchronous & Event-driven: Node.js is known for being non-blocking and event-driven, which makes it great for building scalable applications, especially when handling multiple concurrent connections. This is ideal for I/O-heavy tasks, such as reading files, accessing databases, or handling HTTP requests.

Single-threaded: Despite being asynchronous, Node.js operates on a single thread, but it uses an event loop to handle multiple operations concurrently, making it efficient without needing to create multiple threads.

Package Manager (npm): Node.js comes with npm (Node Package Manager), which allows developers to install libraries and packages for their projects. npm has a huge ecosystem of modules that simplify many tasks, from routing to database interaction.

Use Cases: Node.js is commonly used for building APIs, real-time applications (like chat apps or online games), server-side applications, and microservices.


## Node.js allows you to interact with the file system, including reading, writing, and modifying files.
## Node.js allows you to create HTTP servers, making it ideal for building web applications.
## Express.js framework, which is built on top of Node.js, simplifies the process of creating APIs.
